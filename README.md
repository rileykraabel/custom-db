# Custom LMS Database

This project was completed with a partner as an assignment during the Spring 2024 semester.

We performed relational database modeling, then intialized all tables and internal relationships. I do not have access to this anymore, as it was located on a Remote Desktop at the University.
We connected our database to C# 'Controllers' using .NET Core, and pushed all information to the course-provided HTML site. 

Depending on their role access, users of the application are able to register for and create courses, manage rosters, and change permissions of other users.
